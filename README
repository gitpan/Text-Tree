Text::Tree version 1.0
======================

The Text::Tree module allows the caller to develop a tree structure,
using nested arrays of strings and references.  Once developed, the whole
tree can be printed as a diagram in text characters, with the root of the
tree at the top, and child nodes formatted horizontally below them.
